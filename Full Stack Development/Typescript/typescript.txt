1. What is TypeScript?
-> TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
-> This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

2. Why should I use TypeScript?
-> JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.
-> In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.
-> TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
-> For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.


3. Type Assignment
-> When creating a variable, there are two main ways TypeScript assigns a type:
   1. Explicit
   2. Implicit

-> Explicit Type
Example:
let firstName: string = "Nimit";

-> Implicit Type: TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value:
Example:
let firstName = "Nimit";

4. Built-In Types:
-> JavaScript
   1. number
   2. string
   3. boolean
   4. null
   5. undefined
   6. object

-> TypeScript
   1. any
   2. unknown
   3. never
   4. enum
   5. tuple
