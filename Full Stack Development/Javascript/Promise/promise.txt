Promise: 
-> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
-> Promises are a useful tool for writing asynchronous code in JavaScript. They allow you to write code that executes in a non-blocking manner, which can be especially important when working with API calls or other operations that may take some time to complete.

-> A JavaScript Promise object can be:
1. Pending
2. Fulfilled
3. Rejected

The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.
-> While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
-> When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
-> When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
