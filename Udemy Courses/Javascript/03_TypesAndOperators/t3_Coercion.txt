Coercion:
-> Converting a value from one type to another.

String coercion:
-> String coercion takes place while using the ‘ + ‘ operator. When a number is added to a string, the number type is always converted to the string type.
-> ‘ + ‘ operator when used to add two numbers, outputs a number. The same ‘ + ‘ operator when used to add two strings, outputs the concatenated string.
-> Type coercion also takes place when using the ‘ - ‘ operator, but the difference while using ‘ - ‘ operator is that, a string is converted to a number and then subtraction takes place.

Boolean Coercion:
-> Boolean coercion takes place when using logical operators, ternary operators, if statements, and loop checks. 
-> To understand boolean coercion in if statements and operators, we need to understand truthy and falsy values.
-> Truthy values are those which will be converted (coerced) to true. Falsy values are those which will be converted to false.

Note: All values except false, 0, 0n, -0, “”, null, undefined, and NaN are truthy values.

Equality Coercion:
-> Equality coercion takes place when using ‘ == ‘ operator. 

Note:
false = 0
true = 1
